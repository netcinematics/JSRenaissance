JSRenaissance ~ FSJS ~ Invisible Fruit ~ and The Standard Workflow

JavaScript. The language of the web, the most compiled code on earth, but still so widely unknown and so o often misunderstood. It shocked critics, in recent years, in a rapid and unprecedented transmigration to a FullStack technology. But then, what's more, it flourished in each and every ecosystem that it encounters: Front-End, Server, Database, Build, Visual, Education, Operating Systems and more. 

Is this a controversial stance? You bet. But this is also why it is such an amazing story. JavaScript was sidelined for many years by backroom corporate bureaucracy of security and licensing. But like an ugly duckling story the so called "Toy Language", that just "makes it pretty" has accomplished so much more than was ever originally intended. And the true colors, no matter how historically maligned, are shining through for those who wish to take advantage of the future. The unexpectedly strange-but-true methodology has proven superior and is coming full-circle, and to those that refute or distract this I say clearly the mantra: those who say no - don't know. 

The Architecture of JavaScript has evolved, physically, and in an unprecedented way. It is time to admit this realization so that we can begin to capitalize upon it. And that ill-conceived misconstrued pseudonym JavaScript, is more than ever, primed to be better known as JS - an unmistakable identifier. And in this light, we find ourselves literally and physically, in an enlightenment, a turning point, and in an emergence of new cabilities in architecture. This is were we find ourselves in a world-wide renaissance. 

Welcome. Join me in a journey of discovery and exploration of the yet unseen benefits of a FullSTack-JavaScript and the capabilities they imbue upon our World Wide Web. We will share, unmistakably in evolution of architecture and the reinvention that it brings. But moreover let us stop our foible in the dark, and let us recognize this moment for what it truly is. Ladies and gentlemen we are, you and I, inventing the world wide web as we know it and as we will come to know it - and that is a powerful, profound, and amazing moment for all of the history of mankind. Let us discover this new era of technological prowess with an open mind. That - is a  renaissance. That is the JSRenaissance.

What are the components of the JSRenaissance??
* Understanding the Classical Definition of Renaissance.
       - How we are we similar or dissimilar from the ancestral awakening. 
             To Stone Architecture, and Art. (MVC, Node - DV and WebGL)
       - And how we relate to prior industries of innovation like:
             Automobile, Electricity, and MassMedia cycles.
* "The Standard Workflow"
       - See it, Git it, Use it, and Blend it back. A cyclical ecosystem primed for innovation.
       - The benefits are real, but invisible. This makes the symptoms ~ strange but true.
* FSJS - Full Stack JavaScript.
       - The Unprecedented Transmigration.
* The Dark Ages.
       - The ugly duckling story. It was an issue of security and insecurity alike.
       - Of distraction and awkward mimicry. 
* Real Innovation - solving age old problems.
       - Blocking IO, Multi-Threading.
       - DataTranslation. Bloat.
       - Brutal Language Learning Curves.
       - Fault Tolerance, because it has to be.
* 3E's - Exponential Ecosystem Evolution.
       - GitHub Numbers. Tweet Numbers.
       - MergeBacks.
       - Measuring a Renaissance. Visualizing year over year growth.
       - The Flexibility Factor. And Invisible Fruit.
       - Acceleration, is it occurring. Does it match Moores Law.
       - If it is not exponential what is it, can it be measured.
       - Naming the hierarchies. ?
* Education Revelation
       - What it will mean to be a One To Many Language.
       - What will it mean to programmatic education as a whole.
       - What will it mean for the end consumer.
       - What will it mean for education systems as a whole.
       - What does this mean for humanity as a whole.
* JSRenaissance Looking Forward
       - There is no hard edge, there is no single moment in time. It is a movement of practices and ideas to which specific groups and identifiable persons respond.
More recently, historians have been much less keen to define the Renaissance as a historical age, or even a coherent cultural movement. Randolph Starn, Historian at the University of California Berkeley, stated: "Rather than a period with definitive beginnings and endings and consistent content in between, the Renaissance can be (and occasionally has been) seen as a movement of practices and ideas to which specific groups and identifiable persons variously responded in different times and places. It would be in this sense a network of diverse, sometimes converging, sometimes conflicting cultures, not a single, time-bound culture".
       - What should we learn from history.
       - What should we hope to achieve.
       - How do we measure the ripple effect. How do we uncover invisible fruit.
